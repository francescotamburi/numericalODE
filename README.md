# numericalODE

Collection of methods useful for numerically solving first and second order order differential equations. Each method can be called from command line or imported as a function. Example of a program that uses the methods as imported functions is "assignment.py", which calculates a simple first order differential equation using three appropriate methods and outputs a comparison between each method and the analytical solution as a .csv file ("methods.csv"). "methods_pretty.csv" contains the same data as "methods.csv" in a single table with clearer formatting.
